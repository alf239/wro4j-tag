wro4j Tag Library
=================

We use this library in [Gene Expression Atlas](https://github.com/gxa/gxa) in order to be able
to use compressed resources (JS, CSS) not giving up the ability to debug with separate uncompressed 
files.

The library is based on the [wro4j project](http://alexo.github.com/wro4j/) by [Alex Objelean](https://github.com/alexo).
